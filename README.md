Watch Surfline Surf Cams for (basically) Infinity with No Ads

## More Info

On the old Surfline site, the surf cam pages expose two variables on the window that determine when the cam resets and plays ads. These are `cameraCurrentTime` and `cameraCurrentTimeReset`.

If these two variables are set to something like 1 x 10^9 (+300 years) then the camera won't timeout.

This chrome extension does this for you automagically.
