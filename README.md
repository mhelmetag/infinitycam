# InfinityCam

Watch Surfline Cams for (basically) Infinity with No Ads

## More Info

On the old Surfline site, the surf report cams expose two variables on the window that determine when the cam resets. These are `cameraCurrentTime` and `cameraCurrentTimeReset`.

If these two variables are set to something like 1 x 10^9 then the camera won't timeout.

This chrome extension does this for you automagically.
